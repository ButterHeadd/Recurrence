# Recurrence
A game I'm making. For my final project (probably).
It will be a turn based rpg with only one playable character that can be anything the player desires. A healer, attacker, defender, or multiple.
As well as that, it will utilise timeloops, hence the name. 
While I do intend it to have a story, I'm focusing on the gameplay first and foremost, as this is mainly a project to help me learn more coding techniques.

I began this project on my second term of University, as a way of learning C++. This led to me developing an interest in the language, and doubling down on the game. 
I honestly never imagined I'd get the battle system finished, but it has been done. 

Contemplating redoing it all again in Godot, because graphics are needed and it could be useful. If that happens, I'll probably just use GDScript.

To-Do:
- Fix stat function
    - Allow for exiting during allocation 
- Save function
- Finish inventory system
- Add equips
- NPCs, stores
- Quests, main story + side content

Inspirations:
- Dragon Quest 1
- Bravely Default
- Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon

Story:
Gonna be a generic rpg, party of 4 who have to save the world against a great evil dark lord / reawaken 4 elemental crystals (haven't decided yet), except... the game developer is bad at his job (in game). The game occasionally "glitches", a notable example being the lack of party. Instead of there being 4 party members, there's 1, who has 4 turns instead. Another glitch is the game overs not functioning properly. At first it's just levels being retained, but the further in you get, more goes wrong, you retain equipment on death, money, and other stuff. (The original concept for the game, I love time loops so being able to have an in-game reason that's not been done to death is nice. I hope it hasn't, at least.) Occasional "bug fixes" happen, which just make the mistakes look intentional. Also, the dungeons that battles take place in are randomised every in-game day, with different materials and chests and enemy placements.
