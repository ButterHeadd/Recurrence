# Recurrence
A game I'm making. For my final project (probably).
It will be a turn based rpg with only one playable character that can be anything the player desires. A healer, attacker, defender, or multiple.
As well as that, it will utilise timeloops, hence the name. 
While I do intend it to have a story, I'm focusing on the gameplay first and foremost, as this is mainly a project to help me learn more coding techniques.

Inspirations:
Dragon Quest 1
Bravely Default
